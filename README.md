## Become my student 

**Online spots taken**: `5 / 25`

If you want to learn to build apps like [Sigma File Manager](https://github.com/aleksey-hoffman/sigma-file-manager), you can become my student and learn from me **online**. 
- In about `8 hours`, I will teach you all the basics of programming, development, design, answer all your questions, and teach you what tools to use to develop and design web sites and desktop apps. After this, you will be able to design and develop simple web sites and desktop apps.
- After about `200 hours`, you will get:
  - **Specialization**: Junior grade UI and UX designer (median yearly salary: ~$80,000 in US);
  - **Specialization**: Junior grade frontend (web / desktop app) developer (median yearly salary: ~$90,000 in US);
  - **Potential specializations**: if you keep learning you will eventually reach Middle or even Senior grade level and earn much higher salary;
  - **Potentialy more interesting job**: these lessons might interest you in things you never even thought about, like game development, which might be more interesting than your current job;
  - **Future skills**: You will get the skills needed for the era of automation, and be ready to change your job when it gets automated or in case you just want to change the work field;
  - **General knowledge**: You will learn general knowledge on how everything works in different systems, for example, what programs (tools) to use for different tasks, how the internet actually functions, how do we make computers do what we tell them, how we create artificial intelligence, etc.
  - üéÅ **Supporter rewards**: as a bonus, you will also get all rewards of the "Generous supporter" tier on my [Boosty page](https://boosty.to/sigma-file-manager) for as long as you are attending the lessons.

**Tutoring rate**: $25 / hour (or $12 per person, if you bring 1 friend and attend lessons together at the same time)

You can stop at any point, if you feel like this is not for you.
The hourly rate will increase in the future, once more people join and I have less time.
